/* For this activity, feel free to make use of your code from any of the previous activities. It's HIGHLY encouraged

Your mission, should you choose to accept it is to follow the tasks listed below. (You have no choice in this. It's been accepted on your behalf.) 
    - Note: The json file for all of the pokemon is stored in a variable called pokedex
*/

/* If you decide to make use of and/or reference your previous code you can place it in this comment so it doesn't run.

*/

/* Task 1) Create a form that asks for the pokedex number and uses that to place the information of the pokemon that corresponds to that number on the page
    Rules: 
        - Any additions to the HTML aside from the form and whatever goes inside of that is NOT allowed.
    Hints:
        - Your code from activity two does most of the work for you
        - Remember array indices start at 0, the id of the pokemon isn't necessarily it's index in the array. 
*/




/* Task 2) Add Styling to the previous task (There is a challenge task as well, so consider if you want to spend the rest of your time on this task. I recommend you try the challenge)
    Rules: 
        - CSS editing is fair game (Adding style in the function also works)
        - No HTML editing aside from linking a css file should you choose to go that route
    Hints:
        - If you managed to do styling in one of the previous activity, it'll help here
*/




/* Challenge) Edit your code so you can put in the name of the pokemon instead of the pokedex number to get it's info (If you manage to finish this, help out those around you)
    Rules:
        - Any additions to the HTML aside from the form and whatever goes inside of that is NOT allowed.
    Hints:
        - You need to iterate over the entire json file
        - You need to use an if statement to check if you're looking at the correct pokemon
